# Active-Directory-Automation
PowerShell code to automate administrative tasks via Active Directory

While at my last role as an ICT Service Desk Analyst, I wanted to save some time by automating my tedious and repetitive tasks of finding new users on Active Directory, copying/pasting specific data (such as Username, last login date and NHS email) onto an excel sheet. This idea came from the senior developer after a chat about a career change (Thanks Anthony!)

After inputting the usernames of the new users, my code would reference this excel sheet, to grab and display data from. It would look like so:

Once the code runs, the overwritten excel sheet would look like this:

At this point, I can manually go over the red/blue cells to double check any mistakes and fill the blocks so I can give this data back to the HR Team.
I also made a read me sheet for my colleagues with instructions so that they may use my code and reduce the time spent on new users.

I'm more than happy for other admins to use this code as well (If you're tech savvy) Just credit me!
